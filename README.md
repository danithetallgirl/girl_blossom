# Girl Blossom

Hi there! Welcome to Girl Blossom! Girl Blossom is a command line interface that allows the user to receive a suggested moisturizer based on the input of their skin type.

The gem will then kindly greet the user and shares a short description of how the app functions. When the user selects their skin type, the gem will then return the suggested product for that skin type. The product will include the product brand, product name, price, and product description. Until user types in exit, the gem will continue to ask, "What's your skin type?". When the user types in exit, they are then dismissed with kind goodbye message.
