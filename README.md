# GirlBlossom

Hi there! Welcome to Girl Blossom! Girl Blossom is an app that helps you find the right face moisturizer for your skin type. Whether your skin is dry, normal, oily, or combination, our app will find the product for you.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'girl_blossom'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install girl_blossom

## Usage

To start the gem, type in ```./bin/girl_blossom```. The gem will then kindly greet the user and shares a short description of how the app functions. When the user selects their skin type, the gem will then return the suggested product for that skin type. The product will include the product brand, product name, price, and product description. Until user types in exit, the gem will continue to ask, "What's your skin type?". When the user types in exit, they are then dismissed with kind goodbye message.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
